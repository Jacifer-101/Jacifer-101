## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Jace, and welcome to my profile! 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jace-noah"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I am an IS&T helpdesk technician intern for a medical system by day (night as well depending on my schedule haha), and an Information Assurance student at Western Governors University by night. My eventual goal is to land a job as a Tier 1 SOC analyst or an analyst adjacent job that I can apply all of my IT and security related knowledge to. 

## My Goal
My goal with this repository is to have a place where I can document all of my most impactful projects that will either provide me with deeper insight and hand-on experience in the realm of blue-teaming, give rehearsal of fundamental network system configurations, and sharpen my pencil when it comes to documenting every important step. 

## Projects (Coming Soon)
